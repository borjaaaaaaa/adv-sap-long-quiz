## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).


Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a method for creating software programs that depend on network services, such as those available online. For example the Lala-move application it has the 3 services instead of making its own services it use the already build services that available. For example the first services is the google map it use to track the destination of raider, second services is the paypal, G-cash or any e-wallet that already exist to use as a payment method, and the third services is the Facebook or google account is use for signing in. All of that is already made services that use to make an application because if you make your own services it takes a lot of programming and time to finish the application.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.


-Provides loosely couples services. Because it make more flexibility and more easy to replace, edit, or upgrade without affecting the whole system.

-Provides location transparency with much better scalability, availability and enables service discovery, workload adaptation, and challenge resilience.

-It’s easy to maintenance with reduced cost of application development because of its reusability and faster development.

And many more.

3. Define Microservices.


A Micro services architecture is a software that design where a large, complex application is divided into smaller independent services that communicate with each other with the use of API and each micro services has a responsible of performing a specific task.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.


-Micro services are highly decoupled, each service can be developed, deployed and maintained independently by providing flexibility and agility in development process.

-It is scalability because you can scale individual services based on their specific needs.

-Micro services are fault tolerant because if one service fail, it doesn’t affect the whole application.

-Each service can be built using different.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.


Similarities:
Both SOA and Micro service is loose couples services because both services is flexible and does not affect the whole application while replacing or upgrading.
It also break down large-scale, complex applications into smaller, more flexible components. And offer enhanced scalability to help the organization develop and deploy apps more quickly

Difference:

The difference between SOA and Micro service is, micro service is relies in small individual services that operate on their own while SOA they are sharable and reusable services in the whole organization. 

6. Define Web Services.


A webservices is a collection of standards protocols for exchanging information between two devices or application.


7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.


Exposing Business Functionality on the network - A web service is a controlled code unit that offers functionality to end users or client applications.

Interoperability amongst applications - Different apps can communicate with one another and exchange information and services through web services.

A Standardized Protocol which everybody understands -  Web services use standardized industry protocol for the communication.

Reduction in cost of communication - Web services use SOAP over HTTP protocol, so you can use your existing low-cost internet for implementing web services.


8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.


Loose coupling - A web service's user is not directly connected to the web service. In a system with tight coupling, modifications to the provider may require the requestor to modify the interface. Software systems with a loosely linked design are generally easier to administer and enable easier system integration.

Ability to be synchronous or asynchronous - In synchronous, the client blocks and waits for the service to complete its operation before continuing. Asynchronous operations allow a client to invoke a service and then execute other functions.

Supports document exchange - One of the key advantages of XML is its generic way of representing not only data, but also complex documents. Web services support the transparent exchange of documents to facilitate business integration.


9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.


Service Provider-From an architecture standpoint, the services are hosted by the platform.

Service Requestor-The application that searches for, calls for, or starts communication with a service is known as a service requestor. Under the direction of a human or a program without a user interface, the browser assumes the function of requester.

Service Registry-During development, service requestors locate services and get binding information.

10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.


HTTP - The HTTP standard is allowing more systems to communicate with one another.

SOAP - SOAP (built on XML) standardizes the messaging capability on different systems.

UDDI - UDDI standardizes the publishing and finding of web services.

WSDL - WSDL standardizes the description of web services so providers and requesters are speaking the same language.
